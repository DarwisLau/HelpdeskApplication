The database for the Helpdesk Application written in SQLite3 language.
The scripts in this folder run SQLite database from a Python softwware development kit (SDK).
Running the scripts will either create a new database file or connect to existing database file.
SQLite is serverless, so the database will be just a .sqlite file in the same folder as the Python file.
The connection can be done by importing sqlite3 from Python standard library. No installation is needed.
